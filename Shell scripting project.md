1. Variables: variables can store different data types or values such as strings, numbers, and arrays. The operator = is used to assign values  to variables while the values are output using the variable name, $ alongside the echo command.

2. Control Flow: Bash as an interface has provision for control flow statements like if -else, while loops, case statements, and for loops that control the steps of task execution in scripts. This helps in decision-making and others. Example:
-  Using the if-else statement to execute the script based on certain conditions ( check if a number is positive, negative, or zero).

- Iterating through a list using a for loop: This control flow statement keeps increasing the number from 0 to 5. When it equals 5 the script stops the execution of the task.

3. Command Substitution: this allows the user to capture the output of a command and use it within the script. The backtick and the $() syntax can be used for command substitution.
- backtick use:

- Syntax use:

- Other variants:
-  inclusion of hours, minutes, and seconds.

4. Input and output: bash has a provision for executing input and output.
-  The output can be displayed on the screen using the echo command.
-  can redirect input and output; operator > ( pass output to a file) and operator < (pass input from a file)
-   Grep command | pipes the output of a command as the input of another
