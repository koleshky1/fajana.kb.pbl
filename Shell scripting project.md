1. Variables: variables can store different data types or values such as strings, numbers and arrays. The operator = is used to assign values  to variables while the values are output using the variable name, $ alongside the echo command.

2. Control Flow:Bash as an interface has provision for control flow statement like if -else, while loops, case statements and for loops that controls the steps of task execution in scripts. This help in decision making and other. Example:
-  Using the if-else statement to execute script base on certain conditions ( check if a number is postive, negative or zero).

- Iterating through a list using for loop: This control flow statement keeps increasing the number from 0 to 5. When it equals 5 the script stops the execution of the task.

3. Command Substitution: this allow the user capture theoutput of a command and use it within the script. The backtick and the $() syntax can be used for comand substitution.
- backtick use:
-  error: Git bash does not recognize the command.
-   the error is use to the absence of $ sign utilization and bash does not actuallly recognize the command but gave the needed output.
